## Introduction

It can be used to learn about these two frameworks, and basic Deep Neuron Network to recognize some objects on the image.

## Installation

All the dependencies to compile it are listed on the Dockerfile. You can copy the container warc3l/owlies from Docker Hub to get all necessary dependencies, 
and then generate the executable with make.
